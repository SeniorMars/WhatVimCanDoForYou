# Quick Story

One of my favorite vim links to share is: https://rudism.com/vim-creep/


It carries a lot of sentiment about why Vim is so loved and disliked.


The way I got started using Vim was in High School due to an upperclassmen saying I would never be able to use it...


Now, I realize that in a way he was right, but also wrong...

# What Vim is for most people

- A code editor
- A weird way to flex
- An environment
- A meme

# The Vim internals

Vim has a lot of features that are useful outside programming:

- Spell checking (`:help spell`)
- `:set spell`

| Keybinding  | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| <count>`]s` | Move to the next misspelled word after the cursor   |
| <count>`[s` | Move to the next misspelled word before the cursor  |
| `zg`        | Add the word under the cursor to your spellfile      |
| `zw`        | Add the word under the cursor to a `bad` word        |
| `zug`       | Remove the word under the cursor from your spellfile |
| `zuw`       | Remove the word under the cursor as a `bad` word     |
| <count>`z=` | Suggest a fix for the word under your cursor         |


> The ultimate keybind: `keyset("n", "<leader>z", "[s1z=``")`

---

# Different languages and more keybinds


## Languages I'm learning
- English (`en_us`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- German (`de`)
- Mandarin (`cjk`)
- Korean (`cjk`)

```lua
function spelltoggle()
    if vim.opt.spell:get() then
        vim.opt_local.spell = false
        vim.opt_local.spelllang = "en"
    else
        vim.opt_local.spell = true
        vim.opt_local.spelllang = {"en_us", "de"}
    end
end
```

- `keyset("n", "<leader>5", ":lua SpellToggle()<cr>")`
- `keyset("n", "<leader>sr", ':%s/<<C-r><C-w>>//g<Left><Left>')`


> Note: my statusline tells me which language's spellchecker is active

```lua
local word_count = function()
    if vim.fn.wordcount().visual_words ~= nil then
        return vim.fn.wordcount().visual_words
    else
        return vim.fn.wordcount().words
    end
end
```

# Vim Digraphs


> Digraphs are used to enter characters that normally cannot be entered by an ordinary keyboard.  These are mostly printable non-ASCII characters.

See `:digraphs`

- Use `C-k` to enter a digraph
- Greek letters: (`*`) and:

| Word         | Symbol | Maps to                           |
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Equals       | =      | Cyrillic (= used as second char)  |
| Asterisk     | *      | Greek                             |
| Percent sign | %      | Greek/Cyrillic special            |
| Plus         | +      | smalls: Arabic, capitals: Hebrew  |
| Three        | 3      | some Latin/Greek/Cyrillic letters |
| Four         | 4      | Bopomofo                          |
| Five         | 5      | Hiragana                          |
| Six          | 6      | Katakana                          |

# Plugins


## Coc-word

- Can be use with dictionary (`:help dictionary`), but I prefer this method
- Top 1000 words are automatically added to my ins-completion
- Highly recommended if you can't spell.


## Language tool
> Imagine grammarly, but worse, kinda open source, and with multiple language support

- rhysd/vim-grammarous
- uses the quickfix list
- easy to use

# Conclusion
- If you write text, then vim is a powerful tool
- Once your keybinds are in place, itâ€™s a perfect for many tasks
- Along with data wrangling and the obvious power of using vim for coding
- Vim is perfect for more than just coding, and perhaps many should consider using the tool
- However, you should decide on how you want to use your time
- Over customization may not help you in the long run
- Workflow videos like this help show people the power of vim!
